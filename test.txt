Original text.

First change.  -> Was second commit

change after Changelog added

after revert; revert basically removes/undo the particular commit - in this case the text for NewChangelog was removed but the NewChangelog file (which was committed afterward) stay

added note for log2 addition

commit --amend after adding text includes it to the commit but git status still shows as modified text
